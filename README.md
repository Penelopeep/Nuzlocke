# Nuzlocke Challenge

### IMPORTANT, READ CAREFULLY
Welcome to Nuzlocke plugin, this is important so read carefully. At the moment I (plugin dev) have no way to refresh player characters, so each time when you die you'll lose character from team BUT It won't be gone from your character unless you relog.

All I can do now is ask you to not pick dead character and relog some time after death to properly remove them

## Installation:

- Download the newest jar from release
- Paste it inside *YourGrassCutterFolder*/Plugins
- Profit
